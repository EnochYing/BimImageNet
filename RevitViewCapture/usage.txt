1. when processing a building model multiple batches, after processing each batch (capture and annotate the batch), 
   the BIM model MUST be reset to the original status for a new batch
2. The captured view id may duplicates in different batch. This is fine as all the images are located in relevant space folders, which are unique in the entire building
3. The building level statistics will automatically update with the new batches processed 
4. rendering time is manually obtained based on the timestaps of rendered images
5. when export rendering images from enscape, make sure Camera is set to "Auto Exposure"
6. using external py applications should go to the dist folder instead of build folder
