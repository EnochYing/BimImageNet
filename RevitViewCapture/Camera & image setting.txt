1. iphone6s: [W, H] = [4032, 3024]; 72dpi 

2. Revit default camera: [W, H] = [512, 383], HFOV= 50.2, 72dpi(can be set)
   - it is possible to adjust revit camera's focus, and FOV angle will be changed automatically:

   - after using camera capture a 3D view, it is possible to manually expand the rectangular box, and can export the changed image, 
     but the camera setting is not changed, so the depth and segmentation results keep no changing and not fit with the changed image
   - For a camera, two methods to change the image size (W & H)
     >>>> Method 1: change W or H only by 
                    FitDirection = FitDirectionType.Horizontal/Vertical;
                    ieo.ZoomType = ZoomFitType.FitToPage; 
                    ieo.PixelSize = newWidth/newHeight;
                    !!!!!! Note: the other direction does not scale by the exactly same factor (e.g., W*8, H*8.012) 
     >>>> Method 2: zoom real physical image by 
                    ieo.ZoomType = ZoomFitType.Zoom;
                    ieo.Zoom = 100;
                    ImageResolution = ImageResolution.DPI_72;
                    !!!!!! Note: the zoom scale also not strictly. there are several pixels shiftting                              

3. Enscape: 72dpi (best for screen),   
   - when eanble revit live camera, enscape camera's pose and location are exactly the same with revit camera
   - only when setting HVOF and aspect ratio (W:H) to be same with revit, can the Enscape camera (focus) be exactly the same with revit camera (focus)
   - HFOV: int value, 50 = revit HFOV (50.2) --- can perfectly match
